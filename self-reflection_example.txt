Here's a critique of each implementation:

**Function 1**
The issue with this function is that it only checks for pairs of adjacent numbers in the sorted list. It does not consider non-adjacent numbers that may be closer than the threshold. For example, if the input list is `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0]`, the function will return `False` because it only checks for the pair `(2.0, 3.0)` and not the pair `(1.0, 2.8)`.

**Function 2**
This function correctly checks all pairs of numbers in the input list to see if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. However, it has a time complexity of O(n^2), which may be inefficient for large lists of numbers.

**Function 3**
The issue with this function is that it also only checks for adjacent numbers in the sorted list. Just like Function 1, it does not consider non-adjacent numbers that may be closer than the threshold.

After critiquing each implementation, I would say that **Function 2** is the best implementation because it correctly checks all pairs of numbers to see if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. While its time complexity is O(n^2), which may not be efficient for large lists, it is still a correct and working solution.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Selected function: 2
